# Design Sprint Guide

This document outlines the Design Sprint process for Project 4, following the Double Diamond methodology.

## 📊 Overview

The Double Diamond approach consists of four phases:

1. **Discover** - Understanding the problem
2. **Define** - Defining the challenge
3. **Develop** - Creating solutions
4. **Deliver** - Testing and implementing

## 🔍 Phase 1: Discover

### Goal

Understand the problem space and user needs.

### Activities

#### User Research

- [ ] Identify potential users
- [ ] Conduct user interviews (5-8 users)
- [ ] Create empathy maps
- [ ] Document pain points

#### Interview Questions (Examples)

1. What challenges do you face with [current solution]?
2. How do you currently solve this problem?
3. What would make your experience better?
4. What features are most important to you?
5. Have you tried similar solutions? What worked/didn't work?

#### Deliverables

- Interview notes
- User personas (2-3 personas)
- Empathy maps
- Problem statements

## 🎯 Phase 2: Define

### Goal

Synthesize research findings and define the core problem.

### Activities

#### Analysis

- [ ] Analyze interview data
- [ ] Identify common patterns
- [ ] Create affinity diagrams
- [ ] Define user needs

#### How Might We (HMW) Questions

Generate "How Might We" questions based on user insights:

- HMW help users [achieve goal]?
- HMW reduce [pain point]?
- HMW improve [current experience]?

#### Deliverables

- Problem statement
- HMW questions
- User journey maps
- Key insights document

### Problem Statement Template

```
[User persona] needs a way to [user need]
because [insight].
We will know this is successful when [measurable outcome].
```

## 💡 Phase 3: Develop

### Goal

Ideate and prototype solutions.

### Activities

#### Ideation

- [ ] Brainstorming sessions
- [ ] Crazy 8s exercise (8 ideas in 8 minutes)
- [ ] Dot voting on best ideas
- [ ] Solution sketching

#### Crazy 8s Instructions

1. Fold paper into 8 sections
2. Set timer for 8 minutes
3. Sketch one idea per section (1 minute each)
4. Focus on quantity over quality
5. Build on others' ideas

#### Low-Fidelity Prototyping

- [ ] User flows
- [ ] Wireframes (mobile-first)
- [ ] Information architecture
- [ ] Content strategy

#### Design System Planning

- [ ] Color palette
- [ ] Typography scale
- [ ] Spacing system
- [ ] Component inventory
- [ ] Iconography

#### Deliverables

- Ideation notes and sketches
- Low-fidelity wireframes
- User flow diagrams
- Initial style guide

## ✅ Phase 4: Deliver

### Goal

Test with users and refine the solution.

### Activities

#### User Testing (Lo-Fi)

- [ ] Prepare testing scenarios
- [ ] Test wireframes with 5+ users
- [ ] Document feedback
- [ ] Identify issues

#### Testing Script Template

```
Introduction:
"Thank you for helping us test our prototype. We're looking for honest feedback."

Tasks:
1. "Try to [complete task]"
2. "Find and [do action]"
3. "What would you expect to happen if you [action]?"

Follow-up:
- What was confusing?
- What worked well?
- What would you change?
```

#### High-Fidelity Design

- [ ] Create polished designs
- [ ] Connect to style guide
- [ ] Design all states (loading, error, success)
- [ ] Ensure accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Mobile, tablet, and desktop views

#### Final Testing

- [ ] Test hi-fi prototype
- [ ] Make final adjustments
- [ ] Prepare design handoff

#### Deliverables

- User testing report
- High-fidelity prototype
- Complete style guide
- Design specifications

## 🛠️ Tools & Methods

### Research Tools

- **Empathy Map**: Understanding user thoughts, feelings, actions
- **User Personas**: Representative user profiles
- **Interview Guide**: Structured questions for user research

### Ideation Tools

- **Crazy 8s**: Rapid ideation exercise
- **How Might We**: Reframing problems as opportunities
- **Dot Voting**: Democratic decision-making
- **Affinity Diagram**: Organizing ideas into themes

### Design Tools

- **Figma**: For wireframes and hi-fi prototypes
- **Miro/Mural**: For collaborative exercises
- **FigJam**: For brainstorming and mapping

## 📱 Mobile-First Approach

When creating wireframes and designs:

1. **Start with mobile (320px-375px)**

   - Simplest version of interface
   - Core functionality only
   - Vertical layouts

2. **Expand to tablet (768px-1024px)**

   - Add more content
   - Multi-column layouts where appropriate

3. **Enhance for desktop (1280px+)**
   - Full feature set
   - Optimized for larger screens

## ♿ Accessibility Checklist

- [ ] Color contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 for normal text
- [ ] Color contrast ratio ≥ 3:1 for large text
- [ ] Don't rely on color alone
- [ ] All images have alt text
- [ ] Headings follow proper hierarchy
- [ ] Interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Form inputs have labels
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible
- [ ] Text can be resized to 200%
- [ ] Content is readable in plain language

## 📋 Design System Checklist

### Colors
